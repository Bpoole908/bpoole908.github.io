Plan for GAANN Fellowship Spring 2021

## Plan
- Pass qualification 
- Continue attending teaching seminars (ITCS 8665)
- Act as co-instructor Applied Machine Learning (5156)
    - Perform guest lectures in-class  and develope module materials for Deep learning, CNN, and Docker
    - Hold TA office hours and help sessions
    - Help edit and create labs for all modules

For the Spring 2021 semester my main focus will be acting as a co-instructor for the Applied Machine Learning (5156) course. As this course is async I will be in charge of developing the lectures and materials for 3 modules: Docker, deep learning, and CNN. Further, Ill continue hosting office and creating/editing lab material for all modules.

Further, I plan on completing my qualification exam this semester and then shifting work towards preparing my dissertation proposal. As akin to prior semesters I will continue attending the teaching seminars and working on my teaching philosophy and website. Additionally, if the CTL seminars are available online I will be attending those as well.
