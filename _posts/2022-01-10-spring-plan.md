Plan for GAANN Fellowship Spring 2022

## Plan
- Act as primary-instructor for Intro to Machine Learning (4156)
    - Teach 4156 as a flipped classroom where there is 1 hour of lecture and 2 hours of in-class labs.
    - Continue to refine the 12 modules I created last semester
    - Continue to refine the 3 mini-projects
- Continue working towards proposal
- Submit survey paper to [ACM Computing Surveys](https://dl.acm.org/journal/csur)

For the spring semester, I will be teaching the course Intro to Machine Learning (ITCS 4156) again. The course is an introductory into machine learning concepts. On top of teaching, I will continue to update the materials I developed last semester. Research wise, I will continue preparing for my proposal by further editing my survey submission and continuing work on proposal related papers for publication.
