Plan for GAANN Fellowship Fall 2021

## Plan
- Act as primary-instructor for Intro to Machine Learning (4156)
    - Teach 4156 as a flipped classroom where there is 1 hour of lecture and 2 hours of in-class labs.
    - Develop 12 new modules where each module contains the following:
        - 1 note which contains details about the modules topic
        - video resource material
        - 1 quiz which assess the students knowledge regarding the note and video resources
        - 1 in-class lab which allows students to practice concepts
    - Improve upon the 3 mini-projects which the students work on outside class
- Begin working towards proposal
    - Work towards publishing two papers.
    - 

For the fall semester, I will be teaching the course Intro to Machine Learning (ITCS 4156). The course is an introductory into machine learning concepts. On top of teaching, I will be re-developing the materials for this course so that the course can be taught as a flipped class. This will allow students to practice concepts in-class.

As I have completed my qualification exam I am now working towards proposing. Before proposing I plan to publish at least two papers. Currently, I am working on a survey paper (which was originally my qual exam) and a paper specific to my area of research (brain-computer interfaces).
