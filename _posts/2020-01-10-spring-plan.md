Plan for GAANN Fellowship Spring 2020

## Plan
- Continue attending teaching seminars (ITCS 8665)
- Continue work on teaching philosophy
    - Testing application of philosophy in my teaching mentors classroom 
- Continue experimenting with canvas sandbox
- Continue work on personal website
    - Post all notes, teaching plans/theory, and GAANN related work to personal website
- Attend at least two CTL seminars (TBD)
- Begin helping in teaching mentors class
    - Conduct extra help and problem sessions
    - Assist mentor with in class activities by working with students
    

Come spring 2020 my plans are to begin learning the fundamentals will remain relatively true to what they were in the fall. That is, continued attendance to the teaching and CLT seminars while also continuing work on my teaching tools (Canvas and personal website).

However, my new goal for this semester will be practical application. This will allow me to begin experimenting with my teaching philosophy and ideas. To do so, I plan on developing after lecture materials to further help students with challenging topics. (This is something I did unintentionally in my graduate machine learning study group, which I began to develop a liking for.) In addition, I plan on assisting my teaching mentor with their in class actives. This means working with students one-on-one and in groups to help them better grasp concepts. In some cases I hope to even begin guest lecturing for my teaching mentor, preferably on simplistic and straightforward topics first. Lastly, I plan on interacting with my teaching mentors canvas webpage in order to start gaining an understanding about the workings of canvas.
