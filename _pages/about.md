Welcome! I am a doctoral candidate in Computer Science at the [University of North Carolina at Charlotte](https://cci.charlotte.edu/people/ben-poole/). During my PhD career I have been funded under the [GAANN Fellowship](https://www2.ed.gov/programs/gaann/index.html).

My research interests lie with machine learning, reinforcement learning, brain-computer interfaces, and cognitive science concepts and their application towards human-AI interactions. My work experience ranges from software development at IBM to data streaming at Klarrio.
